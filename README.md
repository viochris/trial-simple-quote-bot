## 📌 Overview
**Daily Quote Automator** is a streamlined automation tool designed to deliver daily doses of inspiration.

Orchestrated by **Prefect**, this bot functions as your personal AI mentor. It leverages **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model via LangChain to generate unique, punchy motivational quotes specifically tailored for programmers, and instantly broadcasts them to a **Telegram Channel**. It is built for reliability with automatic retries and modular task execution.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Generative AI Integration
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Utilizes `langchain-google-genai` to tap into Google's efficient large language model for generating context-aware content.
* **Custom Prompting:** Specifically engineered to create short, impactful quotes for developers, stripping away unnecessary conversational filler.

### 🛡️ Robust Orchestration
* **Prefect Flows:** Wraps logic in resilient tasks with automatic **Retry Policies** (3 retries, 5s delay) to handle potential API timeouts.
* **Error Handling:** Graceful exception management ensures the flow logs errors clearly (e.g., network issues, API limits) without crashing silently.

### 📨 Instant Delivery
* **Telegram Bot API:** Direct integration via HTTP POST requests to send text messages with Markdown formatting support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Orchestrator:** Prefect (Workflow Management)
* **Language:** Python 3.11
* **AI Provider:** Google Gemini API (`langchain-google-genai`)
* **Notification:** Telegram Bot API (`requests`)
* **Environment Management:** `python-dotenv`
